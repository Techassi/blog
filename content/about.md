I'm a backend software developer and tinkerer working on a few small projects and trying new things in Rust, Go, Vue and
TypeScript. Currently building a scalable high-performance DNS [server](https://github.com/portal-rs/portal) with DNS
blocking features and a home router OS, called [vulcan-rs](https://github.com/vulcan-rs), both written in pure Rust.
